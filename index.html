        <h1>Lone Saga - About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I’m a passionate solo game developer with a love for crafting immersive worlds and meaningful stories. 
            From experimenting with Unreal Engine’s vast capabilities to bringing scenes to life with Maya and 
            Substance Painter, I thrive at the intersection of creativity and technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            My journey began with a fascination for games that make us feel something. Whether it’s through exploring 
            uncharted islands, navigating the stars, or stepping into dreamlike adventures, I focus on blending 
            storytelling, artistry, and gameplay to create experiences that resonate deeply.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m currently working on turning my vision into reality, exploring themes of adventure, emotion, and 
            discovery. While I can't say too much yet, I'm excited to share what’s on the horizon when the time comes.
        </p>
        <p>This is just the beginning! Big hug, Cc.</p>
